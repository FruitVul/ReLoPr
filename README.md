## REpresentative LOad PRofiles Generator for Python

Python lib to "easily" generate representative load profiles with python based on VDEW-Loadprofiles 
(https://www.bdew.de/energie/standardlastprofile-strom/)

Hint: Due to the nature of the process the passed electricity demand is not equal to the summed up
energy demand resulting from the generated load profile.

Use at your own caution as the library is WIP and feel free to hint on issues / mistakes. 


ToDo:
- Integrate leap years
- Integrate Load Profile generations for other than households
